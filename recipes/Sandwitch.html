<h3>Sandwitch</h3>
<p>When I get hungry most of the time I make myself a sandwitch and put it on a plate to be fancy 
    and go to my living room and enjoy my sandwitch by the beautiful view. Enjoying this little 
    things is very important in life. We must find enjoyment even in the smallest thing. In the end 
    the joy we experience is the result of our perspective of the reality. 
</p>
<p>Making a sandwith is dead easy. Take your bread and put whatever you want in it. Dont forgt to
    put it in place. Ot you will spill breadcrumbs around. Some believe if you spill breadcrumbs
    around and step on them even by mistake it brings bad luck.
